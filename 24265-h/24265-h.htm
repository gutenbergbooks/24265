<p>The statement, made at the inquiry
into the Dublin strike riots, that 245
policemen were injured during the disturbances
has, we hear, done much to
allay the prevailing discontent among
the belabouring classes.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"<span class="sc">Coaling the Stores</span>" is a headline
which caught our eye in a newspaper
last week. To be followed, after
the strike, we imagine, by "<span class="sc">Storing
the Coals</span>."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A Russian officer, last week, shot the
leader of a gipsy choir in a St.
Petersburg restaurant, not because
he sang out of tune but
merely because he expressed resentment
at the officer's conduct
towards his daughter. It is
thought that the incident may
lead to an Entente between
Germany and Russia.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Our Navy standard of 16
<i>Dreadnoughts</i> to 10 of the next
most powerful Navy is, says Mr.
<span class="sc">C. P. Trevelyan</span>, rough and
ready. Well, in this matter our
standards may or may not be
rough, but let's hope they're
ready, anyhow.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>An organisation called "The
Parents' League" has been
formed in New York for the
purpose of simplifying the lives
of children. This has caused
a considerable amount of uneasiness
in juvenile circles, and it is
said that a "Hands-off-our-jam"
party has already been formed.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>In a letter of Mrs. <span class="sc">Carlyle's</span>
just published, the wife of the
Chelsea sage describes a cat as
"a selfish, immoral, improper beast."
This has given no little satisfaction in
canine circles, where the deceased lady
is being hailed as a human being with
the insight of a dog.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><i>The Cambridge Review</i> is talking of
dropping the publication of the University
sermon. It is possible, however,
that the mere threat may have
the effect of making the sermons more
entertaining.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A volume entitled "The Great Scourge
and How to End it" has made its
appearance. We had imagined this to
be a treatise on the anarchist activities
of a certain section of the Suffragists
until we discovered the name of
Miss <span class="sc">Christabel Pankhurst</span> as its
authoress.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Messrs. <span class="sc">Hutchinson's</span> interesting
<i>History of the Nations</i>, the first part of
which has just appeared, is something
more than a mere compilation of facts
already known to us. We had thought
that both photography and limited
companies were comparatively recent
inventions. An illustration, however,
in this new work, entitled "Charles I.
going to execution," bears the description,
"Photo by Henry J. Mullen, Ltd."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Councillor <span class="sc">Sherlock</span> has been elected
Lord Mayor of Dublin for the third
time in succession, and Sir <span class="sc">Arthur
Conan Doyle</span> will be interested to
hear that there is some talk now of
calling the local Mansion House
"<span class="sc">Sherlock's</span> Home."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Belief in the innocence of the dove
dies hard. At Driffield, last week, a
Mr. <span class="sc">Dove</span>, who was charged with conducting
a lottery, was acquitted in
spite of his pleading guilty.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A music-hall performer gave a turn
in a King's Bench court the other day.
There was a time when a judge would
have objected to his court being turned
into a theatre, but since the advent of
comic judges the line of demarcation
has become blurred.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>According to Dr. <span class="sc">Frank E. Lakey</span>,
of the English High School, Boston,
U.S.A., boys are at their naughtiest
between 3 and 4 <span class="sc">p.m.</span>; and at their
best at 10 <span class="sc">a.m.</span> But surely most boys
are awake and out of bed at 10 <span class="sc">a.m.</span>?</p>

<p>One is so accustomed to think of the
little chaps in millions that this seems
rather a poor attendance.</p>

<p><i>Newly-wedded Husband</i> (<i>fresh from the altar</i>). "<span class="sc">Excuse me
taking the liberty, Sir, but do you happen to know of
any place where my wife could get a little charring

<h2>HONORIFICS.</h2>

<p>A cowardly hoax was recently perpetrated
in Paris, where a number of
politicians consented to assist in
raising a statue to H&eacute;g&eacute;sippe
Simon, the educator of the
Democracy and author of the
famous epigram, "The darkness
vanishes when the sun rises,"
only to discover later that
H&eacute;g&eacute;sippe Simon had never
existed.</p>

<p>Needless to say, this has produced
a profound impression
upon public men in this country,
who are regarding invitations
of a similar character with the
gravest suspicion.</p>

<p>For instance, Mr. <span class="sc">William
Archer</span>, on receiving a request
for his assistance in raising a
monument to <span class="sc">Ibsen</span>, is reported
to have replied cautiously that
he would like to know more
about this writer before giving
an answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Clement Shorter</span>, on
being asked to join the committee
of a <span class="sc">Bront&euml;</span> memorial,
replied suspiciously, "Why do
you ask <i>me</i> of all people?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">J. L. Garvin</span>, on being
approached on the subject of a
bust of Mr. <span class="sc">Filson Young</span>, is
reported to have consulted his
assistant-editor as to whether the name
might not be a pure invention; while
Mr. <span class="sc">G. K. Chesterton</span> remarked, when
asked to assist in raising a bas-relief
to <span class="sc">Charles Dickens</span>, that he didn't
believe there was no such a person.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote><p>"Mr. M'Call, K.C., said Dr. Keats had
charge of the boys in the infirmary, and for
the purpose of maintaining order he was
sometimes compelled to resort to corporal
astonishment."&mdash;<i>Glasgow Daily Record.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Billy Brown (<i>surprised</i>): "Ow!"</p>

<hr />

<p>In our last issue, quoting from a
Johannesburg telegram, we referred to
<i>The Evening Chronicle</i> as a "Labour
organ." Its London Manager writes
protesting against this description; and
we now offer our heartiest regrets for the
grave injustice that we seem to have
done to our South African contemporary.</p>

<h2>THE COMMERCIAL SIDE.</h2>

<p>Now that the Headmaster of Bradfield has decided to
start a "Commercial side," to enable boys to prepare at
school for a business career, it may be of interest to publish
these fragments from the diary of another Headmaster who
has done pioneering work in a similar direction:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>January 20.</i>&mdash;First day of term. This morning, in Hall,
I made the momentous announcement that the School
would shortly have a new "side"&mdash;devoted to Business.
School-boys are usually so conservative that I had anticipated
some signs of disapproval. Nothing of the sort.
The speech was received with loud cheers, renewed when
I prophesied that the Waterloo of the future would be won
on the "Commercial side" of Fadfield. Truly a hopeful
outlook.</p>

<p><i>January 21.</i>&mdash;As I expected, the Commercial side has
been the chief topic of conversation among boys and
masters. The latter are, I fear, reactionary&mdash;realising, no
doubt, their incompetence to deal with business subjects.
The boys are enthusiastic. I am constantly approached in
the corridors by lads who say it has always been their
ambition to become a Tipton or a Whiteridge, or a Gilling
and Warow, as the case may be. One little fellow quaintly
confessed that he had always longed to be a "Mother
Spiegel." Great Britain's future in trade is assured if this
spirit continues.</p>

<p><i>January 22.</i>&mdash;Even the Classical VI. seems interested in
my new project, and questions proving a genuine keenness
were asked me when I was taking <span class="sc">Homer</span> this morning.
One boy propounded the doubtful but stimulating notion
that <span class="sc">Homer</span> was really the name of some early Greek
Co-operative Stores, and that the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> were
parts of a gigantic scheme of advertisements. This is very
illuminative and indicates that a real desire for efficiency
exists in the most unlikely quarters.</p>

<p><i>January 23.</i>&mdash;An example of the sort of prejudice one has
to contend against occurred to-day. Henderson, one of the
House masters, sent across a note asking what I should wish
done in the following case. It appears that a boy in his
House named Montague has by some form of bargaining
already deprived three new boys of their pocket-money for
the term. "Montague has exhibited such an extraordinary
commercial aptitude in this matter," Henderson wrote,
"that I propose to flog him. Before doing so however I
thought I would ask for your assent, as you might prefer
to make him a prefect."</p>

<p><i>January 24.</i>&mdash;Brown Major, the Captain of Football,
has been deputed to ask me if I could arrange a Jumble
Sale match against Giggleswick. Have had to explain to
a boy, Lipscombe, sent up for gambling, that the rule
against this is inviolable, and that I could not accept as
an excuse for his breaking it the fact that he intends, on
leaving school, to adopt the business of a bookmaker.
Specialisation at school in all branches of business is of
course impossible.</p>

<p><i>January 26.</i>&mdash;M. Constantin, the French master, has
come to me with a complaint. Two days ago, for trying
to dazzle him during lessons with a sun-glass, he gave
a boy named Dawkins 500 lines. To-day, instead of the
usual Racine, Dawkins handed him lines copied from an
advertisement in the daily press beginning:&mdash;"Perhaps
you are suddenly becoming stout, or it may be that you
have been putting on weight for years...." As Constantin
is disposed to adiposity, he is convinced that Dawkins
meant this for impertinence. Dawkins, however, has
explained to me that he is profoundly interested in Patent
Medicines, the sale of which he hopes to take up as soon
as he has qualified on the Commercial side. Pardoned
Dawkins and accepted M. Constantin's resignation.</p>

<p><i>January 27.</i>&mdash;I fear the school is taking the Commercial
side too literally&mdash;with unforeseen results. To-day there
was a regrettable incident in the tuck-shop, outside the
door of which, unknown to Mrs. Harrison, a placard was
nailed up announcing "Harrison's Winter Sale. All goods
at sacrificial prices. Must be cleared. No offer refused."
As a consequence the boys burst into the place in a crowd,
ate and drank everything they could lay hands on, and paid
for nothing. I have undertaken to rectify this matter.</p>

<p><i>January 28.</i>&mdash;Mutiny is rampant. The boys, inflated
by their success in the tuck-shop, held "A Great White
Sale" in most of the dormitories last night. As a consequence,
all towels, sheets, pillows, flannels, etc., are
inextricably mixed up, and a very large number can only
be described as "remnants." Seven masters have resigned,
including Herr Wolff, who was informed by a boy that he
refused to handle the works of Schiller, because they
were "made in Germany." Personally flogged the boy.</p>

<p><i>January 29.</i>&mdash;Things are becoming intolerable. Three
boys appeared in the lower Modern class this morning in
frock coats and false waxed moustaches which they must
have written to London for. They were sent up to me and
had the audacity to explain that they hoped to be shop-walkers
some day and wanted to practise. Another boy
asked if a Hair Drill could be substituted for the ordinary
drill. Verily the reformer's task is a thankless one.</p>

<p><i>January 30.</i>&mdash;<i>Actum est</i> ... This morning I announced
to assembled boys that I should not proceed with the
Commercial side. The speech was received in silence,
except that one boy (whom, I regret to say, I was unable
to identify) called out, "And the next thing, Sir?" I fear
there is no real commercial zeal as yet among boys.</p>

<p>The shopkeeper said he had not got
it in stock, but he would get it for me.</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"By to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"Before lunch?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"For certain?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Very well then, I would have it.</p>

<p>"Can I send it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, someone will call."</p>

<p>Very well. It should be ready for
my man before lunch.</p>

<p>How did he know I had a man? I
wondered. I had never been to the
shop before. Do I look like a man
who has a man? I suppose I must.
Yet I always rather hoped that I didn't.</p>

<p>What had I said exactly? I had
said, "someone will call."</p>

<p>Either, then, "someone" means, in
such shops, a man-servant; or the fact
that I am a man-keeping animal is
visible all over me.</p>

<p>I went on to wonder if, should he
see Lidbetter, he would know that he
belonged to me. Did I not only betray
the fact that I kept a man, but also
what kind of a man I kept?</p>

<p>Good old Lidbetter&mdash;what should I
do without him? I wondered. How
get through the day at all? How, to
begin with, get up?</p>

<p>The morning tea, the warmed copy
of <i>The Times</i> and <i>The Mail</i> (only
Lidbetter would ever have thought of
warming them), the intimation that
the bath (also of the right temperature)
was ready&mdash;how should I be thus
looked after without Lidbetter?</p>

<p>And then the careful stropping of my
razors. Without Lidbetter how could
I get that done for me?</p>

<p>Without him I am sure I should
never change my neck-tie till it was
worn out, or get new shirts until mustard
and cress had begun to sprout on
the cuffs of the old ones, or have a crease
down my trousers like Mr. <span class="sc">Gerald Du
Maurier</span>, or go out with anything but
a dusty overcoat and dustier hat.</p>

<p>But with Lidbetter...!</p>

<p>How do people get on without Lidbetters?
I wondered. I suppose there
are men who do not keep men and yet
exist&mdash;men who can't say, "My man"?
An odd experience.</p>

<p>I wondered how old he was by now&mdash;Lidbetter.
Difficult to tell the age of
that type, so discreet and equable. He
might be anything from thirty to fifty.</p>

<p>And what was his other name?
Curious how I had never ascertained
that. I must ask him, or, better still,
get him to witness something and sign
his full name. My will, say.</p>

<p>Talking of wills, perhaps I ought to
leave Lidbetter something after such
faithful service.</p>

<p>Good old Lidbetter!</p>

<p>Thus musing I walked home.</p>

<p>The next morning I went to the
shop and asked for the parcel.</p>

<p>"You surely won't carry it yourself?"
the shopkeeper said. "I would have
sent it only I understood that your
man would call."</p>

<p>"I haven't got a man," I said. "I've
never had one."</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>A fragment of a diary, signed H.H.A.,
which may be picked up in Bouverie
Street some day.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;Although I continue to
wear an enigmatic smile in public, I
may confess to myself that the situation
causes me anxiety. The Home Rule
Bill was passed five days ago, and
already there are signs of military
activity in Ireland. Anthony thinks I
ought to proclaim martial law. In the
course of a short lecture at breakfast
this morning he referred to the historic
case of South Africa, and reminded me
of the enthusiasm with which the
Unionist Party greeted this stirring
exhibition of the strong hand. Martial
law, he says, supersedes all other law,
and the deportation of any person
whose presence is not desired becomes&mdash;&mdash;At
this point I had him
deported to the nursery, for I desired
to be alone. All the same I feel that
there is a good deal in what he says,
and I shall think it over to-night.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Martial law proclaimed.
I have decided to be The Strong Man
of England. Force may be no remedy,
but it is much esteemed by the Unionist
Party, and I don't see why <span class="sc">Winston</span>
should be the only popular member of
the Cabinet.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Excellent. <span class="sc">Carson</span> has
been safely smuggled out of the country.
He travelled from Belfast to Liverpool
in a packing-case labelled "Oranges,"
and was then embarked in a whaler
for Greenland. The ship, I understand,
has no wireless installation and will not
stop at any port on the way. As he
had to leave Belfast rather hurriedly,
without packing, I have lent him a
spare suit of <span class="sc">Wedgwood Benn's</span> clothes.
The authorities have orders to deal with
the other leading members of the Ulster
Provisional Government in the same
way.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;The Ulster leaders have
been safely deported. Unfortunately,
there was no ship immediately
available for them, and at the present
moment they are in a pantechnicon
labelled "Theatrical Troupe" (a tip
from <span class="sc">Botha</span>) touring the Cromwell
Road. They go up and down twice in
a day, I am told, stopping nowhere on
the way. Without their leaders the
Ulstermen are weakening, and they
may be expected to accept the Home
Rule Act peaceably in the course of a
few days. Martial law is certainly an
extraordinary solvent of the most
difficult situation, and I can only
wonder that I never thought of it
before.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;However hard one tries
one can never please everybody. In
a fierce speech at Bootle last night,
<span class="sc">Bonar</span> denounced me as (among other
things) a Tyrant, a Dictator, and an
Autocrat! (The other things were not
so polite.) By an exhibition of the
strong hand I have practically stifled
the Ulster Revolution, and this is all
the thanks I get from the Unionist
Party. I have sent him a note, asking
him to drop in in a friendly way and
chat about it. We haven't had one of
our little conversations for a long time.</p>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Bonar</span> refused my invitation
indignantly, and actually made
another speech on the same lines at
Pudsey. Even the Liberal papers
confessed that it was enthusiastically
received; in fact, P.W.W. in <i>The Daily
News</i> went so far as to say that a
staunch Radical in the gallery "paled
suddenly" and later on "blenched."
There was only one way of dealing
with this situation. <span class="sc">Bonar Law</span> had
become a serious danger to the State
(me), he was fomenting rebellion against
authority (mine), and he would have to
go. I telegraphed instructions, and
within half an hour <span class="sc">Bonar</span> had left
Pudsey for Farnborough as a grand
piano. To-night he is strapped on to
an army aeroplane and launched into
the <i>Ewigkeit</i>. The aeroplane has no
wireless installation and will, I am
informed, stop nowhere until it reaches
its destination.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Strict Press censorship
ordered. Unionist Papers are forbidden
to comment adversely on my
operations. As a result, the first
nineteen columns of <i>The Pall Mall
Gazette</i> were blank this afternoon.
In the evening edition, however, the
editor could no longer restrain himself,
and he is now waiting at the
docks as a consignment of cocoa for
<span class="sc">Shackleton's</span> South Pole party.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Overheard an unexpected
compliment (paid me by a
Unionist) in a District train this evening.
This gentleman said, "After all,
he's a strong man. One does know
where one <i>is</i> with a man like that."
He had to confess, however, that he
didn't know where <span class="sc">Bonar Law</span> was.
Neither do I. My new-found friend
got out at the Temple, and I wish I
could have followed him and asked him
to tea one day, but the fact that I was
disguised and on my way to Blackfriars
Pier to see the <span class="sc">Lord Mayor's</span> departure
in a submarine prevented me. I have
always wanted to witness one of these
deportations, and certainly the police
were very nippy, if I may use the
word. The <span class="sc">Lord Mayor</span> descended
from a taxi in a straw-filled crate
labelled "St. Bernard&mdash;fierce," and was
in the submarine in no time. It was
his own fault for summoning a non-party
meeting of protest at the
Guildhall. I hate these non-party
meetings&mdash;they're always more insulting
than the other sort.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Anthony says that I shall
have to get an Indemnity Bill through
the Commons; otherwise, when martial
law is over, I may get hanged or
something. This is rather annoying.
Deported Anthony to bed, but could
not get rid of my anxiety so easily.
The Unionists of course will vote
against an Indemnity Bill, and so, I
fear, will a good many Liberals and
Labour men, who say that I am
undemocratic. Awkward.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;Still a little anxious about
the I.B., but a great victory over the
<span class="sc">Chancellor of the Exchequer</span> at golf
in the afternoon has restored my spirits
somewhat. We were square going to
the eighteenth, and when I got into
a nasty place in the bunker guarding
the green it seemed all over; but with
a sudden inspiration I proclaimed
martial law (which, as Anthony says,
supersedes the ordinary laws) and teed
my ball up. Thence easily to the green
and down in ten, <span class="sc">David</span> arriving in his
usual mechanical eleven. He was a
little silent at tea, I thought.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Excellent. This martial
law is a wonderful thing. On
Monday I had the whole of the
Opposition kidnapped and sent down
by one of the special Saturday trains,
well guarded and labelled "Football
Party," to Twickenham. The train
was guaranteed to stop for some hours
at every station on the way, and is
not due at Twickenham till to-morrow
morning. Meanwhile my Indemnity
Bill went triumphantly through the
House this evening, and now all is
well.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;End of martial law.
Rather a dull day on the whole.</p>

sorry that we cannot see our way to
using <i>Red Shadows</i>. The idea is an
excellent one, if a trifle improbable.
But you must be aware that West
Africa has been worse handled by
fiction-writers than any other locality,
and we are afraid we dare not risk
publishing a story in which the writer
has drawn on his imagination for local
colour, however vivid that imagination
may be. The West African expert at
our office assures us that <i>Red Shadows</i>
contains some inaccuracies which would
be bound to spring to the eye of any
reader who had been near the West
Coast. We cannot imperil the reputation
of a magazine so widely circulated
as ours, and we feel that in returning
the MS. we are in some degree safeguarding
your own. Thanking you for
the many excellent stories you have let

time to visit West Africa, but I still
hope to. When I do, I will perhaps
let you have some tales "hot from the
oven." In the meantime I find the
Travel section of our local library a
more comfortable and probably a more
accurate source of copy. But I still
have to draw on my imagination to
some extent. The Mendes may be pure
Yanks for all I know to the contrary;
but I hope for their own sakes they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg 90]</span>aren't Zishtis. It sounds such a horrible
thing to be.</p>

<p>As for the "leopard" murders, I got
my information from Major Kingsley,
D.S.O., who has been a Government
officer in Nigeria and Sierra Leone for
fourteen years, so there may be something
in it. As he is a close friend of
mine I sent my story to him out there
for him to look through before letting
you have it, and he very kindly posted
it direct to you. He has written to
tell me that the ignorance shown in it
was such as to preclude any possibility
of improvement by revision.</p>

<p>By the way, Major Kingsley was the
author of <i>Red Shadows</i>. He asked me
as a special favour to godfather it, as
he believed an unknown writer stood
no chance. It is a perfectly true story.
My kindest regards to your expert.</p>

<h2>A MODERN IDYLL.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>With acknowledgments to various distinguished
writers in this vein.</i>)</p>

<p>To me the robin is a peculiarly attractive
bird. It bears itself with a
sort of pompous pathos which moves
me to a friendly tear and gentle
laughter.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>One came to the ledge
of my parlour window
the other morning, a
not infrequent occurrence.
"Good morning,
Robin Red-breast,"
quoth I; and it acquiesced
in an expressive
silence. The
conversation is generally
one-sided on these
occasions. "Bird," I
continued, "it may
interest you to know
that I am writing a
book. What about, you
wonder? About any
old thing that happens
to crop up&mdash;yourself,
for instance." The
robin tripped hither
and thither with vast
self-importance. "Not
so much of it," said I.
"It isn't your intrinsic
worth but the fact that
you chanced to crop
up first, that got you
this publicity."</p>

<p>The robin flew away
in high dudgeon as Martha
entered the room
bearing the boiled eggs
and tea with which it
is my custom to break
my fast.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>How long the greater
tragedies of life lie
hidden beneath the
careless surface! From
a chance remark of this
excellent Martha's, I
have but now discovered,
after many
years' experience of it,
that what I have always
fondly supposed to be tea, she,
who makes it, equally fondly supposes
to be coffee.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>There is only one other thing worth
mentioning about Martha, and I will
mention it. For very many years, as
she is in the habit of telling me once a
week, she has been walking out with
a policeman. This has suggested to
me a quaint thought, that to marry a
policeman is the cheapest and most
effective way of insuring against
burglary, but otherwise, I confess, I
have shown and felt but little interest
in this <i>affaire de c&oelig;ur</i>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A letter lay on the table beside my
plate. It was addressed to me. I picked
it up and, holding the envelope in my
left hand, with the first finger of my
right hand I tore open the flap. I then
withdrew the enclosure and, standing
with my back to the window so that
the light fell on to the written sheet,
I read it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>It was from my sister, my little
sister Clare, and it told me that she
was engaged to be married. My sister,
my little sister Clare, engaged to be
married, and to a partner in a firm of
publishers of all people! Here was
news indeed! I own that Clare's publisher
interested me very much more
than Martha's policeman.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>I remember nothing more until I
looked up a few moments later to see
a robin once again upon my window-ledge.
I would not
swear that it was the
same bird, but, feeling
that one robin was as
good as another, I told
it all about Clare's
publisher and what this
might mean to all of us.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Some days later I
came down to breakfast,
to find another letter
lying on the table beside
my plate. This letter
also was addressed to
me. Having gone
through much the
same process as that
used with regard to my
earlier correspondence,
I discovered that this
was from Clare's <i>fianc&eacute;</i>.
He thanked me for my
very kind congratulations
of the 13th ultimo,
and went on to say
that, with regard to the
latter part of my letter,
he was not quite sure
exactly what an idyll
might be, and so my
interesting description
of my embryo book
conveyed little to him.
Even so, he went on,
he would have been
honoured to publish
any book written by
any relative of his dear
Clare, but that he
dealt, to be candid,
exclusively in legal
text-books.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>To Martha, entering
at this moment, I confessed
that there was
at least this to be said
for her and her man,
that they had never concealed their connection
with that odious thing, the Law.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Later, I read an extract from my
manuscript aloud to the robin. He
wore an air of abstraction and I could
see that his thoughts were running on
other matters more immediately concerned
with his own interests.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>To me the robin is a peculiarly
human bird.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="sc"><i>Revues</i> and Things</span>.<br />
<i>Park Lane.</i><br />
<i>January 31st.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="sc">Dearest Daphne</span>,&mdash;I've been putting
in quite a pleasant little time down at
Much Gaddington with Bosh and Wee-Wee.
Theatricals were the order of
the night, and the best thing we did
was a <i>revue</i> written for us by the Rector
of Much Gaddington, who's a perfectly
sweet man and immensely clever. It's
a better <i>revue</i> than <i>any</i> of those at the
theatres, and as that dreadful Censor
had, of course, nothing to do with it
the dear rector could make it as snappy
as he liked. Wee-Wee and I were two
"plume girls," Sal and
Nan, in aprons, you
know, and feathers
and boots stitched with
white; and our duet,
"Biff along, Old Sport!"
with a pavement dance
between the verses,
fairly brought down the
house. The rector himself
was <i>impayable</i> in
his songs, "Wink to me
only," and "Tango&mdash;Tangoing&mdash;Tangone!"
But the outstanding
feature of the whole
affair was certainly
Dick Flummery, who
introduced his new and
sensational <i>Danse &agrave;
trois Jambes</i>, entirely
his own invention!</p>

<p>What Dick doesn't
know about dancing
isn't worth knowing,
and he says all the
steps that <i>can</i> be done
with two legs have <i>been</i>
done, and for <i>anything</i> really novel
another leg must be added. So he's
had a clockwork leg made, and he
winds it up before beginning and makes
its movements blend in with the steps
of his <i>real</i> legs, and the effect is
simply enormous!</p>

<p>People wrote to Wee-Wee from far
and near begging to come and see
"Hold Tight, Please!"&mdash;that's the
name of the rector's <i>revue</i>&mdash;so we
decided to give it in the village school-room
for charity. Since then Dick's
been fairly snowed under with offers
from London managers. They offer him
big terms, and if his colonel decides
that the prestige of the regiment won't
suffer through one of its officers doing
a three-legged dance at the Halls Dick
will accept. If the colonel objects,
Dick will still accept, for then he'll
send in his papers, and go on the music-hall
stage in earnest.</p>

<p>The rector has also had good offers
for "Hold Tight, Please!" and he's
busy toning it down before it's given
in front of the dear old prudish public.
He made us laugh one evening by
telling us how he met his bishop lately
at a Church Congress or something, and
the bishop said, "There's a report that
you've been seen once or twice lately
at the Up-to-Date Variety Theatre,
Piccadilly Square, London. You're
able to contradict it, of course?"
"Oh, that's quite all right, bishop," answered
the dear rector; "I <i>have</i> run
up to town several times in order to
go to the Up-to-Date, but it was for
business, not amusement. I'm responsible
for the new ballet there, 'Fun,
Frills and Frocks.'" So of course the
bishop had no more to say.</p>

<p>I was talking to Norty yesterday
about the state of Europe, and <i>when</i>
we're to know who's who in the Near
East, and which of the kingdoms out
there are to be absorbed or abolished
or allowed to go on; and he threw a
new light on things by telling me that
these matters are a good deal in the
hands of the <i>stamp-collectors</i>&mdash;that
when <i>they</i> agree among themselves as
to what's to be done it <i>will</i> be done.
A great many people who matter very
much indeed are stamp-collectors, it
seems, and it would make an <i>immense</i>
difference in the value of their collections
if certain countries were absorbed
or abolished or allowed to go
on. For instance, suppose anyone had
a complete set of Albelian stamps, and
Albelia wasn't allowed to go on, the
set would become almost priceless.
Norty says also that <i>heaps</i> of stamp-collectors
who have been opposed tooth
and nail to Home Rule on principle
have been won over by the Coalition
with the promise that an absolutely
<i>sweet</i> set of Irish stamps would be
issued as soon as H. R. became an accomplished
fact. <i>Ainsi va le monde.</i></p>

<p>The swing of the pendulum is going
to make the coming season a <i>stately</i>
one. It will be correct to be haughty
and dignified. <i>Features</i> will be <i>de
rigueur</i>, and aquiline noses will be very
much worn. Dancing is to be deliberate
and majestic, and partners will not
touch each other; as Teddy Foljambe
put it, "Soccer dancing will be in and
Rugby dancing out." As far as one
can see at present, the
most popular dance at
parties will be the war-dance
of the Umgaroos,
a tribe who live on the
banks of some river
at the back of beyond.
I can't tell you anything
about them except
that they were
found near this river
doing this dance, and
someone's brought it
to Europe. It's very
slow and impressive,
and a native weapon,
like a big egg-boiler
with a long handle,
is carried. The dance
grows faster towards
the end and the native
weapon is twirled. In
a crowded room there'd
be a little danger here,
and one would have
to practise carefully
beforehand. Already
Popsy Lady Ramsgate's
maid, has brought an action
against her for "grievous bodily harm."
In practising the war-dance of the Umgaroos,
Popsy twirled her weapon too
wide and struck the girl on the head.</p>

<p>What do you think of the New Music,
my child? No answer is expected.
It's a question few people <i>dare</i> to
answer. Norty's definition of the New
Humour&mdash;"the old Humour without
the Humour"&mdash;won't do for the New
Music. It's quite out by itself. But
on the whole it's darling music, full of
new paths to somewhere or other, and
ideas and impressions of one doesn't
know what, and sprinkled all over with
delicious accidentals that seem to have
been shaken out of a pepper-pot.</p>

<p>I've just got some piano studies of
Sch&ouml;nvinsky's, to be played with the
eyes shut and gloves on, and they're
too wonderful for words!</p>

<h2>THE OBLIQUE METHOD.</h2>

<p>"I want to engage the next cook
myself," I had said to my wife.</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Chiefly," I said, "because I am the
only person in the house who minds
what is placed on the table. If the
food is distasteful I complain of it; you
defend it; and we lose our tempers.
Now it is perfectly clear that you
cannot guard against certain culinary
monstrosities when you engage a cook.
I can. And coming from a man it will
impress her more."</p>

<p>"Why can't I do it?"</p>

<p>"Because you haven't," I said. "You
have engaged scores of cooks in your
time and everyone does a certain thing
which infuriates me."</p>

<p>"Have it your own way," she said.</p>

<p>I meant to.</p>

<p>In course of time the prospective
cook was ushered into my study. If I
liked her she was to stay.</p>

<p>"Good morning," I said. "There's
only one thing I want to discuss with
you. Apple tart. Can you cook apple
tarts really well?"</p>

<p>She said it was her speciality, her <i>forte</i>.</p>

<p>"Yes, but can you do them as I like
them, I wonder."</p>

<p>How did I like them?</p>

<p>"Well, my idea of an apple tart is
that there should be so much lemon in
it that it tastes of lemon rather than
apple."</p>

<p>"Mine, too," she said. "I always
put a lot of lemon in."</p>

<p>"And," I went on, "wherever the
tart doesn't taste of lemon I like it to
taste of cloves."</p>

<p>"I was just going to say the same.
I always put in plenty of cloves."</p>

<p>"In short, the whole duty of a cook
who is given an apple to cook is," I
said, "to see that every scrap of the
divine&mdash;of the flavour of the apple is
smothered and killed."</p>

<p>She looked at me a little in perplexity.</p>

<p>"Isn't it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," she faltered.</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "I've recently been
to see my doctor and he says that
there are two things I must never
touch again, at least in an apple tart:
lemon and cloves. Otherwise he can't
answer for the consequences. Will you
help me to avoid them, at home at
any rate? Will you?"</p>

<p>She was a good woman with a kind
heart and she promised.</p>

<p>She has kept her promise.</p>

<p>Apple tarts in our house are worth
eating.</p>

<hr />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg 96]</span><h2>TRYING ON.</h2>

<p>"I am going to London," I said.</p>

<p>"Going to London?" said the lady of the house. "What
for?"</p>

<p>"To live a double life," I said. "Many men do it and
are never found out till they have been dead quite a long
time. I'm going to begin to-day, and first I'm going to call
on my tailor."</p>

<p>"But you can't call on your tailor in those clothes."</p>

<p>"Why not?" I said. "He made the clothes, and the
least he can do is to look at them after I've worn them all
these years."</p>

<p>"Dad's going to London in his old brown suit," said
Helen to Rosie, who had just entered the room.</p>

<p>"Oh, but he simply <i>can't</i>," said Rosie in a shocked voice.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> like the suit," said Peggy. "The trousers are so
funny."</p>

<p>"They do bag at the knees," I admitted. "But then all
sincere and honourable trousers do that. There is, of course,
an unmanly variety that never bags and always keeps a
crease down its middle, but you wouldn't have me wear
those&mdash;now would you?"</p>

<p>"You can wear what you like," said the lady of the house,
"so long as you don't wear what you've got on."</p>

<p>"Well," I said with dignity, "I'm not the man to insult
an old friend. I shall wear this suit, and, what's more, I
shall get my hair cut, too."</p>

<p>"That's right; get yourself cropped like a convict."</p>

<p>"You ought to be proud," I said, "to have a husband
who's got any hair to crop. Some husbands are quite
bald."</p>

<p>"And some want to look as if they were quite bald."</p>

<p>"Very well," I said, "I will give up the hair-cutting.
Next week you shall see me in love-locks for the rest of my
life."</p>

<p>I then went up-stairs and changed into patent leather
boots, black tail coat and all that is necessarily associated
with a black tail coat. This costume I completed with a
top hat extracted from its dim and dusty lair, a dark overcoat,
a walking-stick and a pair of gloves. Thus attired I
set out for the station.</p>

<p>In the garden I found the junior members of the family
gathered together to escort me. When they saw me they
assumed an air of profound solemnity and doffed imaginary
hats in my honour.</p>

<p>"He's got his Londons on after all," said Peggy, thus
lightly alluding to my serious garments.</p>

<p>"Will his lordship deign to take my humble arm?" said
Rosie.</p>

<p>"John," said Helen brightly, "run on, there's a good
boy, and see if they've got out the red carpet. We must
certainly knight the station-master."</p>

<p>They then formed up as a festal band&mdash;mostly big drums&mdash;and
preceded me to the garden gate, where they scattered
and left me with a final cheer.</p>

<p>At about 3 o'clock in the afternoon I found myself in the
West-end&mdash;not, of course, in the whole of it, but in that
particular part of it where my tailor has his establishment.
Up to that moment I had been eager to see him, but now
that I stood before his door all desire had vanished just as
a toothache disappears when you get almost within forceps
distance of a dentist. However I encouraged myself.
"These clothes," I said, "have been waiting for months in
a half-sewn state and with makeshift button-holes. They
must be put out of their misery. It's to-day or never."</p>

<p>My entrance was warmly welcomed: "Try on? Yes, Sir.
I'll call Mr. Thurgood. Will you step in here, Sir?"</p>

<p>I stepped in through a door in a glass partition and found
myself in the familiar torture-chamber. The old coloured
plates of distinguished gentlemen in dazzling uniforms still
hung on the walls. <i>Their</i> trouser-knees didn't bulge an
inch. They fitted into their suits as wine fits into a
decanter. Why couldn't I be like that? Also there were
the looking-glasses artfully arranged to show you your
profile or your back, a morbid and detestable revelation of
the unsuspected.</p>

<p>"You're quite a stranger, Sir," said Mr. Thurgood,
coming briskly into the room, accompanied by a transitory
acolyte bearing clothes. "Shall we try the blue serge
first?"</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Thurgood," I said, "we will first talk about
uniforms. Could you make me a uniform like that?" I
pointed to an expressionless person tightly wedged into a
dark blue dress.</p>

<p>"An Elder Brother of the Trinity House," said Mr.
Thurgood. "I did not know&mdash;am I to congratulate? Of
course we shall be proud to do it for you."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps not yet, Mr. Thurgood. We must wait
and see&mdash;ha-ha&mdash;wait and see, you know. Let us get on
with the blue serge." I took off my coat and waistcoat.</p>

<p>"Let me help you with the trousers," said Mr. Thurgood.
"They'll come off quite easily over the boots."
They did, and I caught a glimpse of my undergarment as
they came off, and clapped my hands on my knees. Why
had I not noticed this before? Each knee was picturesquely
darned in an elaborately cross-hatched pattern.</p>

<p>"I don't think," I said, "we'll worry about the trousers.
I can take them on trust."</p>

<p>"Do you really think so, Sir? It's a difficult leg to fit,
you know. Plenty of muscle here and there. Not like
some. You set us a task. There's a good deal to contend
against in a thigh like yours."</p>

<p>"That's it," I cried with enthusiasm. "You can't do
yourself justice unless you've got lots to contend against.
I shall make it harder for you if I don't try on, and your
triumph will be all the more glorious."</p>

<p>"It's a curious thing," said Mr. Thurgood, looking
meditatively at my hands; "I've got just such another
patch of darning on <i>my</i> knee," and he pulled up his trouser.
"It's funny how you forget to notice a little thing like
that."</p>

<p>"In that case," I said, "we will proceed with the trying
on," and I removed my hands. "I've got two of them,
you see."</p>

<p>"So have I," said Mr. Thurgood. "They generally go
together."</p>

<p>From a story in <i>The Pall Mall Gazette</i>:&mdash;</p>

them. The good oft lies interred in their bones, but maybe it was only
folly with me, not evil.'"</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="sc">Willie</span> was certainly right, but that's not exactly how
(in <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>) he put it.</p>

<blockquote><p>"When the men went to the scale, the Welshman was found to be
half-a-pound over the stipulated 8st., but he was allowed time to get
this off, and just before three o'clock he passed the weight, while
Ladbury weighed 7st. 14 <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> lb."&mdash;<i>Yorkshire Post.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Rather bad luck on the Welshman, who had been sprinting

extra four ounces were entirely ignored.</p>

<p>"It's got to be," I said.</p>

<p>I must have been thinking aloud, for
Joyce said quickly&mdash;</p>

<p>"What's got to be?"</p>

<p>"The silver," I said.</p>

<p>"It doesn't sound sensible," said
Joyce.</p>

<p>"It isn't," I said, "at all sensible,
but it's inevitable."</p>

<p>"What's inevitable?"</p>

<p>"That about the silver," I said.</p>

<p>"But you didn't say anything about
the silver, except that it's got to be."</p>

<p>"Well, it's got to be&mdash;hypothecated."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"I mean," I said, "that I'm&mdash;er&mdash;temporarily
embarrassed, and the silver
has got to be made security for a
loan&mdash;pawned, in fact&mdash;so that I can
pay the balance of the rent and catch
up with my outgoings. Is that clearly
put?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly; but we can't spare the
silver just now. The Armisteads are
coming to tea on Friday."</p>

<p>"But," I protested, "you don't understand.
We don't keep a valuable
stud of silver tea-things for the Armisteads'
amusement, but for our own,
and as&mdash;er&mdash;collateral." I was sure
this would be beyond Joyce.</p>

<p>"But what am I to do?"</p>

<p>"Call out the reserves," I said.</p>

<p>"But they're such a mixed lot," said
Joyce. "I should be ashamed of having
anyone to tea with them."</p>

<p>"Better," I said, "than having the
bailiffs to dine and sleep."</p>

<p>"Ugh," said Joyce, "is it as bad as
that?"</p>

<p>"It is," I said, "and all because
Short won't send that cheque on
account of royalties till I've made
some alterations to the last chapter.
Our landlord is becoming unmanageable.
Besides," I said, "I hear there
have been one or two burglaries in this
road lately, so the silver will be safer."</p>

<p>"Look here," said Joyce, who declined
to be scared by the idea of
burglars. "To-day's Tuesday. Wait
till Thursday. Something's sure to
turn up."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "a bailiff. But I'll
wait till to-morrow if you like."</p>

<p>"Good. And in the meantime we'll
both think hard of some other way."</p>

<p>That evening at dinner Joyce said,
"I have an idea, but I'm not going to
tell you yet. Have you thought of
anything?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said. "I've got a brilliant
scheme, but I'm going to keep it to
myself for the present."</p>

<p>"I knew you'd think of a way out,"
Joyce said, "if you gave your mind to
it."</p>

<p>My brilliant scheme was to pop the
silver, and I managed to get away with
it next morning (Wednesday) without
arousing Joyce's suspicions. I got &pound;20
on it at the local hypothecary's, squared
the landlord, leaving a few pounds in
hand, and hid the ticket in my writing-case.
I spent the morning on the
alterations for Short, and the afternoon
on the links, and lost three good balls&mdash;curious
coincidence, as I had found
three such useful ones at the pawnbroker's
in the morning.</p>

<p>The evening of Wednesday passed
off quietly. Joyce looked very cheerful
and didn't say a word about the silver,
so I felt sure she hadn't missed it.
Uncle Henry had called, she said, and
wanted us both to go and dine with
him at the Fitz on Saturday night, and
she had accepted.</p>

<p>"Good," I said.</p>

<p>I suppose I looked very cheerful
because Joyce said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your scheme's come off, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," I said, "it's come off&mdash;er&mdash;quite
well. How's yours?"</p>

<p>"Mine was quite successful, thank
you, and I shall get a new frock for
dinner on Saturday."</p>

<p>As I didn't want to give my scheme
away just then, I didn't press Joyce to
reveal hers, and we retired for the night
with honours easy.</p>

<p>When I got home on Thursday from
a day in town, Joyce met me at the
gate. She looked scared.</p>

<p>"We've had a burglar," she said.
"The silver's gone. Oh, why didn't
I take the warning?"</p>

<p>This was my big scene, but I never
believe in rushing a good climax, so I
simply said&mdash;</p>

<p>"The silver gone? Dear, dear. A
burglar, did you say? I told you they
were about."</p>

<p>"Really, I'm not joking," said Joyce.
"Both Jessie and I were out this afternoon
and he must have got in by the
scullery window, which I'm afraid was
unlatched."</p>

<p>I was enjoying her consternation
immensely.</p>

<p>"A burglar?" I repeated. "How
very interesting!"</p>

<p>"Oh," said Joyce, stamping her foot,
"can't you <i>do</i> something?"</p>

<p>"My dear Joyce," I said, fixing her
with my eleven-stone look, "let us stop
this mummery. Behold the burglar!"
and I struck the attitude that I thought
would have done credit to Sir <span class="sc">Herbert</span>.</p>

<p>"You!" she said; "but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said. "Alone I did it.
Aren't you glad? Come, do look glad
and ring down the curtain. The play
is over."</p>

<p>"But that was on Wednesday."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "it was. On Wednesday,
at ten o'clock of the forenoon."</p>

<p>"Well, on Wednesday after lunch,
I wanted an envelope and at last found
one in your writing-case. I also found
a ticket."</p>

<p>"Then you knew all the time?"</p>

<p>"Listen," said Joyce. "Uncle Henry
called&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And asked us to dinner&mdash;good
egg!"</p>

<p>"Well, I borrowed &pound;25 from him and
took the silver out of pawn."</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

<p>The author of <i>Pantomime</i> (<span class="sc">Hutchinson</span>) has placed me in
something of a quandary. In an ordinary way, finding a
story with this title, in which moreover the chief characters
are spoken of as Princess and Principal Boy, and the
narrative is broken every now and then by fantastical little
dialogues with Fairies, I should have said at once that here
was a clever young writer whom a natural admiration for
the work of Mr. <span class="sc">Dion Clayon Calthrop</span> had betrayed into
the sincerest form of flattery. But Mr. (or perhaps Miss)
<span class="sc">G. B. Stern</span> has disarmed me by an open avowal of
discipleship and a dedication of the tale to Mr. <span class="sc">Calthrop</span>
himself. It is a quite pleasant tale. Personally I may
confess to a preference, which I suspect most readers will
share, for getting this precise form of whimsical romance
from the original firm; but there is more than enough
spirit in <span class="sc">G. B. Stern's</span> work to persuade me that he or she
will one day be worth reading in an individual and
unborrowed style. Two things in this story of <i>Nan</i> pleased
me especially. One was the chapter relating her experiences
at the Dramatic Academy, which is full of life and actuality,
and should be read by all middle-aged supporters of that
institution who wish to obtain a glimpse of its hard-working
and high-spirited heart. The other is the episode
of the muddled elopement, in which <i>Nan</i> and <i>Tony</i>, having
got as far as Dover on their way to the Higher Liberty,
severally&mdash;&mdash;But I don't think I will spoil for you the
delightful comedy of what happens at Dover by repeating
it. This at least shows <span class="sc">G. B. Stern</span> as the owner of a
happy gift of humour. Let us have some more of it soon,
please, but if possible in a more original setting.</p>

<hr />

<p>Mrs. <span class="sc">Leverson</span> is one of those authors who baffle
criticism by sheer high spirits. She gives me first and
last a prevailing impression that novel-writing must be
tremendous fun; and this is so cheering that it is really
impossible to be angry with her. Otherwise I might have
some very sharp things to say about her light-hearted
disregard of syntax and punctuation. Her pronouns, for
example, are so elusive that not only am I frequently in
doubt as to whom the heroine will marry in the end but as
to which of the characters is speaking at any given moment.
And not infrequently what can only be careless proofreading
leaves sentences that contradict each other into an
effect of nonsense. But just when I should be noting
all these subjects for legitimate censure I am probably
devouring page after page with giggles of delight for the wit
and jollity of them. <i>Bird of Paradise</i> (<span class="sc">Grant Richards</span>)
is in every respect a worthy companion to its predecessors.
There are no very severe problems in this story of a group
of Londoners, but plenty of the lightest, most airy dialogue,
and some genuine character-drawing, conveyed so
deftly that you only detect it afterwards by the way in which
the persons remain in your memory. The whole thing, of
course, is modern to the last moment; tango-teas and Russian
ballets and picture-balls besprinkle the conversation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg 100]</span>There is even a passage about a certain famous shop that
made me wonder whether the New Advertising, familiar to
readers of the afternoon journals had also invaded the
realm of fiction. You will observe that I have made no
effort to repeat the story; as it contains at least three
heroines and five heroes the task would be too complicated.
But you can take it on trust as a comedy of want of
manners, brilliantly alive, exasperatingly careless, and altogether
the greatest fun in the world.</p>

<hr />

<p>Once upon a time there were two highwaymen, <i>Charlie</i>
and <i>Crabb Spring</i>; two men, not highway, <i>Saul Coplestone</i>
and <i>John Cole</i>; two marriageable sisters, <i>Sarah</i> and
<i>Christina Rowland</i>. The highwaymen, being pestilential
and murderous, badly wanted catching; of the two potential
heroes, <i>Saul</i> was a stout enough fellow on the surface but
a poltroon at bottom, while <i>John</i>, though less terrific in
physique, was modest and
courageous to a degree. Of
the sisters, <i>Sarah</i> had most
of the looks and <i>Christina</i>
all the merits, so that at the
beginning of things both <i>Saul</i>
and <i>John</i> were concentrated
upon the former, who, being
a little fool, preferred <i>Saul</i>,
but, being also a little vixen,
encouraged both. The brothers
<i>Spring</i> appearing Dartmoor
way, <i>Sarah</i> promised,
in an expansive moment, to
marry whichever of her
suitors caught them single-handed.
This was apparently
impossible, but nevertheless
one of them did it. Need it
be said which? Need it be
said which of the two sisters
the proved hero ultimately
took to wife? No, this is one
of those cases in which it is
impossible for the reader,
with the best intentions in
the world, not to prophesy
and prophesy accurately.
None the less it is worth
while to spend time and money on <i>The Master of Merripit</i>
(<span class="sc">Ward, Lock</span>) for the following adequate reasons. It is
from the pen of Mr. <span class="sc">Eden Phillpotts</span>; if the conclusions
are foregone, the excitement throughout is intense; the
local colour and the supernumerary characters are charming
as usual, and the scheme by which the villains were
entrapped is admirable in design and execution. This
learned clerk, for all his expert knowledge of the art of
catching highwaymen, neither anticipated it nor, upon the
most critical reflection, is able to find a flaw in it.</p>

<hr />

<p>I was discussing Mr. <span class="sc">Gilbert Cannan</span> with a friend, and
he said, "I have read many reviews of his books, nearly
all of them good reviews, but not one that made me want
to read the book itself." Well, I am afraid this one won't
make him want to read <i>Old Mole</i> (<span class="sc">Martin Secker</span>). The
hero, <i>Old Mole</i>, otherwise <i>H. J. Beenham, M.A.</i>, had
himself written a book, and this is what Mr. <span class="sc">Cannan</span> says
of it: "The essay was cool and deliberate, broken in
its monotony by comical little stabs of malice. The
writing was fastidious and competent. Panoukian thought
the essay a masterpiece, and there crept a sort of reverence
into his attitude towards its author.... Then,
to complete his infatuation, he contrasted Old Mole with
Harbottle." I am no <i>Panoukian</i>. Mr. <span class="sc">Cannan's</span> opinion
of <i>Old Mole's</i> book may stand as mine of Mr. <span class="sc">Cannan's</span>
book. But I can understand the <i>Panoukian</i> attitude; and
when I read the <i>Panoukian</i> reviews&mdash;referring inevitably to
the "damnable cleverness" of Mr. <span class="sc">Cannan</span>&mdash;then I suspect
that they have been contrasting him with the <i>Harbottles</i>
of the literary world, the gushers and the pushers and the
slushers. After a month of these a fastidious writer may
well infatuate a reviewer. For myself, who have not had
to wade through <i>Harbottles</i>, I remain unstirred by <i>Old
Mole</i>. Not a single character, male or female, moved me
to the least interest; they were all cold, dead people, and
Mr. <span class="sc">Cannan</span> talked over their bodies. Clever talk, certainly&mdash;he
shall have that adjective again&mdash;but when it was over
I had a wild mad longing to take to the Harbottle. Even
Mr. <span class="sc">Hall Caine</span> ... but this is morbid talk.</p>

<p>In a preface to <i>In the
Cockpit of Europe</i> (<span class="sc">Smith,
Elder</span>) Lieut.-Colonel
<span class="sc">Alsager Pollock</span> states that
"the personal experiences of
George Blagdon, in love and
war, have been introduced
solely in the hope of inducing
some of my countrymen
to read what I have to
say about other important
matters"&mdash;an ingenuous
confession which deprives
my sails of most of their
wind. Otherwise I should
have said that this book is
not so much a novel as an
airing-ground for grievances,
adding for fairness that
these grievances are national
and not personal. A terrific
war with Germany gives
<i>Blagdon</i> opportunity to win
various distinctions, and
<i>Marjory Corfe</i> affords him
ample justification for falling
in love; but although I
grant, even in the face of
that preface, that <i>Blagdon</i> is not completely a puppet, he
is used mainly to emphasize his creator's ideas. Officials
at the War Office who read <i>In the Cockpit of Europe</i> may
possibly require some artificial aids to digestion before they
have finished it, but both they and the Parliamentary and
Ministerial strategists will have to admit that their critic's
honesty of purpose is beyond all manner of doubt.</p>
